            Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Nicholas Broeders and I am a third year software 
             engineering student studying at Western University. I created this website so that I would have 
             a place to easily share my projects and give people a chance to get to know a bit about me.

            </p>

            My passion for programming began back in high school when I was 15 and I took the introductory 
            computer science course that my high school offered. I loved it. I loved that when I was 
            programming, I could make anything that I could dream up and I spent the course making games and 
            funny programs with my friends. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I continued to take computer science in my two remaining years at high school and this is where I 
            grew to enjoy the challenge that programming provided. I liked that creating programs made me think 
            logically and I enjoyed finding the best solution to a problem that I was facing.

            Studying at a western university the past three years has given me the opportunity to improve and 
            grow both as a person and a programmer. I have been able to learn what is industry standard and how 
            to not only create successful projects but how to write good code and how to work in teams in a 
            professional environment. The last three years have only reinforced my passion for coding and no 
            matter how many projects I work on I still get excited with the endless possibilities that each new 
            project provides.
