                Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Nicholas Broeders. I am a software engineer new grad 
                having completed my undergraduate degree from Western University in 2023. I created this website 
                so that I would have a place to easily share my projects and give people a chance to get to know 
                a bit about me.

            </p>
            <p>
                My passion for programming began back in high school when I was 15 and I took the introductory 
                computer science course that my high school offered. I loved it. I loved that when I was 
                programming, I could make anything that I could dream up and I spent the course making games and 
                funny programs with my friends. I continued to take computer science in my two remaining years at high school and this is where I 
                grew to enjoy the challenge that programming provided. I liked that creating programs made me think 
                logically and I enjoyed finding the best solution to a problem that I was facing.
            </p>

                Studying at western university gave me the opportunity to improve and 
                grow both as a person and a programmer. I have been able to learn what is industry standard and how 
                to not only create successful projects but how to write good code and how to work in teams in a 
                professional environment. I was fortuante enough to apply what I learned in the classroom to real world problems 
                during my summer internship at Amazon in 2022. During my three months at Amazon I worked with and met so many 
                amazing people and had the opportunity to so much about software that can't be taught in a classroom.

            <p>
                After all the time writing code and learning about software I am as passionate as ever. Even as I have finished my 
                bachelor degree and left school I am driven to continue learning more about software and becoming a better developer.
                I hope that this website is a testement to that so please take a look around, maybe play a game of minesweeper or leave 
                your mark on git place.
